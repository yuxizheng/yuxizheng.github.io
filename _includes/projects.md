  <div class="contents"> In my final year of undergraduate studies, I created a word memorization app, learning to use SwiftUI for its simple yet effective capabilities. I designed the user interface, structured the word list and dictionary database, and after thorough testing, successfully launched it on the App Store. After this I know that developing a good app requires trials and errors, effort for design and intricate teamwork.</div>
