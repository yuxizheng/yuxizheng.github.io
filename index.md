## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Emory University. I held undergraduate degree in Statistics, with a concentration in Data Science from Renmin University of China, Beijing. My passion is to build software that is influential and useful.

My journey in software development further expanded with the creation of my iOS application, Neword, which was a significant learning experience for me. Driven by my passion for software development, I am eagerly seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute and further develop my skills in this dynamic field. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy drawing and playing guitar. I always seek to improve my skills.

## Career Interests
- **Software Engineering:** IOS application development, game development.
- **Data Science:** data mining with deep learning models.
- **Natural Language Processing:** text processing, information retrieval, and LLM.


## Awards
- **[2023-2025]** Merit-based Scholarship, Emory University
- **[2019-2021]** Scholarship of Academic Excellence, Renmin University of China
- **[2022]** Scholarship for International Program, Renmin University of China

## Research and Competitions

- **[Nov. 2022]** <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/overview" target="_blank">*Kaggle Multimodal Single-Cell Integration Competition*</a>  Silver Medal Team (5%)
I anticipated the kaggle competition with two other schoolmates. The objective of the competition is to build models to predict gene expression given chromatin accessibility and predict protein levels given gene expression based on high dimensional chromatin data from selective patients. We used truncated SVD to conduct dimension reduction on the chromatin accessibility data, trained the DNN model with Optuna for tuning, trained the LightGBM model and ensembled results.

- **[Oct. 2021]** Predicting Economic Development Using Deep Learning
I worked as Research Assistant in the Computer Vision Group at Renmin University. I participated in works of constructing VGG model for extracting high-dimensional feature vectors from remote sensing images, providing cluster information for economic development, and Constructing ResNet18 model for predicting economic development level through remote sensing images.
